1. RPPA data produced by us 
12 samples have been probed with 441 antibodies:
* 2 samples from PC-3 cell lines treated by DMSO
* 2 samples from PC-3 cell lines treated by AZD drug
* 2 samples from PC-3 cell lines treated by MS21 drug
* 2 samples from MD-MBA-468 cell lines treated by DMSO
* 2 samples from MD-MBA-468 cell lines treated by AZD drug
* 2 samples from MD-MBA-468 cell lines treated by MS21 drug

data are available in GEO : 

Scripts used to analyze differential protein levels associated with drug treatments and heatmaps associated are available under the folder "RPPA".

2. RPPA data from CCLE
data are available in https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/about

Script used to visualise heatmap of a set of selected proteins with a mutation patters in a set of genes in the cell lines studied in this paper is available under the folder "RPPA_CCLE".

3. Visualisation of mutation patterns of a set of cell liens 
data are available in https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/about

Script used to visualise a mutation patters in a set of genes in the cell lines studied in this paper are available under the folder "Visualisation".
